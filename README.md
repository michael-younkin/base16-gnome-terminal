## Installation
Firstly, clone the repo and source the scheme file of your choosing:

    git clone https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-gnome-terminal.git ~/.config/base16-gnome-terminal
    $HOME/.config/base16-gnome-terminal/base16-default.dark.sh

Next, restart or open Gnome Terminal. Right click on the terminal and select profiles the menu that pops-up. The scheme you just sourced should be available for selection.

Note: If you are using a newer version of Ubuntu (eg. 16.04+, possibly earlier) you need to install `dconf-cli` first so the shell scripts can access gnome-terminal's settings. To do so, run `sudo apt-get install dconf-cli`.
